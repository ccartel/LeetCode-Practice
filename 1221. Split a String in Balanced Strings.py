Balanced strings are those that have an equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.

Given a balanced string s, split it into some number of substrings such that:

Each substring is balanced.
Return the maximum number of balanced strings you can obtain.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
Output: 4
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
Example 2:

Input: s = "RLRRRLLRLL"
Output: 2
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRRLLRLL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
Note that s cannot be split into "RL", "RR", "RL", "LR", "LL", because the 2nd and 5th substrings are not balanced.
Example 3:

Input: s = "LLLLRRRR"
Output: 1
Explanation: s can be split into "LLLLRRRR".
 

Constraints:

2 <= s.length <= 1000
s[i] is either 'L' or 'R'.
s is a balanced string.


class Solution:
    def balancedStringSplit(self, s: str) -> int:
        curr = 0
        final = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == 'L':
                curr -= 1
            else: 
                curr += 1
            if curr == 0:
                final += 1
        return final
